# Lessons From Advent of Code

About 15 days ago, I gave up on Advent of Code for this year. Partly because I wanted to focus on finishing a comp sci certificate and partly to prepare for a data science bootcamp. Now that it's Christmas, I'm letting myself look at solutions.  

SPOILER ALERT: This post includes solutions to Advent of Code 2019 Day 02.  

To add some learning value to this, I'll be writing some blog posts on lessons I learn.  I'll start with [Day 02](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/2). I actually solved this one myself, so I'll be comparing aspects of [my solution]() with that by [Joel Grus]()
